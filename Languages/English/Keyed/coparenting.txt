"You don't spend enough time with Delilah"
- it is hard to spend more time with delilah when you have such short windows and conditions to adhere to 
- it is hard for you to follow up on an offer of "you can ask for delilah" because it is a vague statement
- you need specifics. a schedule of what days/times are best for gloria, or for her to offer a specific time instead of leaving you to figure it out. 
- specific instruction applies to everything. open ended suggestions are hard for you, because of ADHD/autism. something like "we should hang out sometime" or "you should work on something productive" are vague and open ended, and your brain doesn't know where to start. you need to be provided with examples and specifics. instead of "hang out sometime" it should instead be "can we hang out on this day/time". instead of "let's do something", provide options to pick from.
